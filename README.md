# BK-Track
This project is inspired by the last one, only this time, it is intended to be used by any user and not by a bank account manager. Here the user can perform the following: creating a bank account or log in if it already exists, depositing an amount, withdrawing an amount, checking the current balance, currency converter, payment of invoices with email verification, and deleting the account. The app is a desktop application, written in java with some GUI elements from JFrame library, and it uses MySQL database along with JavaMail API for sending the verification code on the email of the users. You can find the JavaMail API, along with all .jar files needed here: https://javaee.github.io/javamail/
